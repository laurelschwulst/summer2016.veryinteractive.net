======================
This website is for the Summer 2016 semester of Introduction to Interactive Design at Yale. Its design is based on the main veryinteractive.net theme. This class in lead by Laurel Schwulst.

### Colophon

Design and programming is by [Beautiful Company](http://beautiful-company.com).

The site is built on [Kirby CMS](http://getkirby.com/).

### Installation

After downloading, add a new folder “content” to the root directory. Inside “content”, add two new empty folders: “error” and “home” and "syllabus".

I like to use [MAMP](http://mamp.info) to locally run PHP. If you use MAMP, place folder in MAMP’s “htldocs” folder. Navigate to /panel and you should be on your way.
